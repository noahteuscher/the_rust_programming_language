# The Rust Programming Language

This repository contains some simple Rust programs I wrote while working through The Rust Programming Language, a wonderful introduction to the language put together by the Rust team. The book is available [online](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and here on [Github](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).
